**Release version 0.6** (10-2018)

## Introduction

[lowRISC][lowRISC] is a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to
produce a secure, flexible, and fully open source System-on-Chip (SoC). We are
building upon RISC-V processor core implementations from the RISC-V team at UC
Berkeley. This aims to be the ideal starting point for derivative open source
and commercial designs.

This tutorial adds further functionality towards the final SoC design:

* An eight packet buffer for Ethernet reception.
* Bare-metal GDB debugging over JTAG without any extra hardware.
* Processor speed doubled to 50MHz.
* Colour Console with proper PC-compatible keyboard events.
* Ethernet boot-loader DHCP support, ten times faster boot-loading.
* SD-Card boot-loader comprehensive card detection base on u-boot.
* Platform-level interrupt controller support.
* All peripheral data paths 64-bit width.
* Latest RISCV-kernel and Debian userland with advanced package tool.

The build environment and pre-built images support the same platform as the previous releases, a competitively priced

* The Ethernet transceiver library is due to Alex Forencich (http://alexforencich.com/wiki/en/verilog/ethernet/readme). The preview version was translated from VHDL written by Philipp Kerling (https://github.com/pkerling/ethernet_mac)
* Palmer Dabbelt maintained the Linux kernel port to RISCV
* Andrew Waterman and a large team at SiFive developed the Rocket CPU
* Manuel Montecelo, Karsten Merker and Aurelien Jarno developed the Debian port to RISCV (https://wiki.debian.org/RISC-V#Creating_a_riscv64_chroot_from_a_merged_repository_with_debootstrap) and all assisted with debugging the bootstrap procedure on LowRISC.
* Rick Chen and the u-boot team provided the basis of the first stage MMC/SD boot loader
