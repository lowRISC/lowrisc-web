This is the first release of the lowRISC chip. It provides simple,
but fully functional, support for tagged memory. In the following
releases, we will provide tag support in the Spike simulator and add
support for the L2 cache. We will also explore better ISA and core
support for tags. Current work is also developing an untethered version
of the SoC with the necessary peripherals.
