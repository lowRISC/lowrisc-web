This tutorial should be followed by those who are not familiar with the previous
version of the lowRISC. All the same facilities as the debug-v0.3 release are available.
For more details, consult [debug enumeration and the general software usage with the RTL simulation]({{<
ref "docs/debug-v0.3/simulation.md" >}}), and [example debug sessions]({{< ref "debugsession.md" >}}).

The FPGA example has changed however, due to the Minion being intimately involved in booting.
Consult the [FPGA example]({{< ref "docs/minion-v0.4/fpga.md" >}}), which is 
based on the Nexys4 DDR board.
