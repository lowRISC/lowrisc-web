### Structure of the git repository

The structure of the repository is as follows:

 * `fpga`: FPGA demo implementations
   * `board`: Demo projects for individual development boards.
     * `nexys4`: Files for the Nexysâ„¢4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA Board.
 * `debian-riscv64`: Scripts to bootstrap a Debian Linux RISCV system
 * `riscv-linux`: The Linux RISCV kernel with LowRISC device drivers
 * `rocket-chip`: The Rocket core and its sub-systems.
   * `firrtl`: Hardware description intermediate language
   * `hardfloat`: Hardware floating-point arithmetic unit
   * `torture`: Tricky tests that stress the CPU
   * `riscv-tools`: The cross-compilation and simulation tool chain. [[Compile and install RISC-V cross-compiler]]({{<ref "docs/riscv_compile.md">}})
     * `riscv-fesvr`: The front-end server that serves system calls on the host machine.
     * `riscv-gnu-toolchain`: The GNU GCC cross-compiler for RISC-V ISA.
     * `riscv-isa-sim`: The RISC-V ISA simulator [Spike](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim#risc-v-isa-simulator)
     * `riscv-opcodes`: The enumeration of all RISC-V opcodes executable by the Spike simulator.
     * `riscv-pk`: The proxy kernel need for running legacy programs in the Spike simulator.
     * `riscv-tests`: Tests for the Rocket core.
 * `src`: The top level code of lowRISC chip.
   * `main`: The Verilog code for hardware implementation.
   * `test`: The Verilog/C++(DPI) test bench files
 * `qemu`: User mode emulation of RISCV instruction set

### Download the code

The code is hosted in the
[lowRISC chip git repository](https://github.com/lowrisc/lowrisc-chip). All
external repositories are fetched as submodules. In case you want to work on multiple branches,
give each checkout a unique name (such as lowrisc-chip-refresh-v0.6)
You need to clone the proper branch (`refresh-v0.6`):

    git clone -b refresh-v0.6 --recursive https://github.com/lowrisc/lowrisc-chip.git lowrisc-chip-refresh-v0.6
    cd lowrisc-chip-refresh-v0.6
 
Submodules that did not need to be modified for this release are hosted in the original repository, but the version
will be frozen at the version that we have tested, which probably will not be the latest.

Next steps:

* [Install Xilinx Vivado] ({{<ref "docs/xilinx.md">}})
