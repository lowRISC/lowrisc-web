For this release we have set the goal to create the basic debug
infrastructure for lowRISC. Before going into the details, we want to
give you an overview about where we are heading with the debug
infrastructure. Essentially, there are two methods to debug a
processor:

 * With *run-control debugging* the developer controls the processor
   core by setting breakpoints and stepping through instructions. This
   is what most people understand as debugging and `gdb` is probably
   the dominant tool for it.

 * *Trace debugging* differs from that by sampling the processor
   execution (program counter etc.) and generating a "trace" of the
   program execution. Most importantly this happens non-intrusively,
   meaning there is no impact on the program execution. Especially for
   multicore system-on-chip, it enables debugging of concurrency
   issues or performance bottlenecks. Finally, other hardware
   elements like a DMA or memory controller can be easily extended to
   generate traces.

While we have support for run-control debugging in the roadmap, we
currently focus on trace debugging. So for our first release we have
defined the following functionalities we want to support:

 * Generate a function trace (enter and leave functions) for the
   program

 * Allow minimally intrusive software instrumentation with trace
   events

 * Memory access and initialization

 * Reset the system and cores remotely

 * Serial communication (console) via the debug system

In the picture below you can find an updated overview of the lowRISC
system architecture. If you compare it to the
[previous SoC overview]({{< ref "docs/untether-v0.2/overview.md" >}}) you
can see that the major change and main topic of this tutorial is the
new debug infrastructure.

You can find the functionalities covered by modules throughout the
system. For best scalability and modularity we decided to connect the
debug modules with a separate network. Currently we use one debug ring
as a compromise between throughput and resource utilization. The
following figure focuses on the debug system.

The figure also shows the connection to the host PC that communicates
with the debug modules with *debug packets*. The actual data transport
between the host and the debug system is abstracted by using the
*Generic Logic Interface Project (glip)* which provides a simple
bi-directional FIFO interface and different physical interfaces like
UART, USB and JTAG.

Work on the the debug infrastructure has been produced as part of the
[Open SoC Debug](http://www.opensocdebug.org) project, where you can
also find a
[broader introduction](http://opensocdebug.org/docs/overview/). The
debug infrastructure presented in this tutorial is just the first
step. Before we jump into the details and get some hands-on
experience, we want to briefly outline where the debug subsystem is
headed:

 * Once a *run-control interface* is available for the Rocket core we
   will include it as a debug module.

 * Full system traces quickly blow up to multiple gigabyte per
   second. *(Cross-)Triggers and filters* help reducing the trace size
   and focus on the problem.

 * *On-chip trace processing* with a (dedicated) minion core can be
   used to aggregate and process basic trace information to high level
   information (knowledge).

 * *Trace buffering and output* on a separate high speed port or to
   DRAM broadens the use cases of the debug system.

Please [get in touch with us]({{< ref "community" >}}) if you have ideas
and opinions about future directions we should take. Now
it's time to learn more about the debug system or jump into using it:
