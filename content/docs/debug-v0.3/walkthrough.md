In this main part of this tutorial you will learn about the debug
features we have added to lowRISC. After introducing the
[debug enumeration and the general software usage with the RTL simulation]({{<
ref "simulation.md" >}}), we will introduce the different features in
[example debug sessions]({{< ref "debugsession.md" >}}). Finally, a
full [FPGA example]({{< ref "docs/debug-v0.3/fpga.md" >}}) is given based on the Nexys
4 board.
