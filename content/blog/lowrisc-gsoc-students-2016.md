The 2016 Google Summer of Code is now 
[underway](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and we're 
delighted to be working with five students, covering a variety of interesting 
projects. They have all introduced themselves over the past few weeks on [our 
project mailing 
list](https://listmaster.pepperfish.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lowrisc-dev-lists.lowrisc.org).
Many thanks to everyone who applied, to the mentors who volunteered, and to 
Google for sponsoring this programme. If your application was unsuccessful, I 
hope you'll try again next year.

The [projects for lowRISC in the 2016 
GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6271463900315648/)
