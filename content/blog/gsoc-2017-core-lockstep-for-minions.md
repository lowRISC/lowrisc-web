+++

This year, as part of [Google Summer of 
Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) we had the pleasure of 
working with Nikitas Chronas. Alongside his degree studies, Nikitas had become 
involved with the [Libre Space Foundation](https://libre.space/) and developed 
a strong interest in the possibility of open source hardware in 
[CubeSats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat). Fault tolerance of some 
sort is important for harsh environments, and Nikitas worked to add fault 
tolerance through the implementation of [core 
lockstep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockstep_(computing)) for the 
PULPino-based minion 
core subsystem. This was a really successful project which ended up 
making contributions in areas beyond the core lockstep focus:
documentation, code quality, support for the Arty FPGA development board, and 
even prototyping a code generation mechanism. See the [detailed write-up]({{< 
ref "docs/gsoc-2017/core-lockstep.md" >}})
for all the details, and below for the all-important blinky lights demo.
