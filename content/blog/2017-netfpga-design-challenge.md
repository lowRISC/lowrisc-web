As most of you know, the majority of full-time development on lowRISC takes 
place at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. However, we're far 
from the only open source hardware activity at the University. Our colleagues 
on the NetFPGA project have an open source design challenge that many readers 
of this blog might be interested in. See the [design challenge 
website](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netfpga/challenge2017/), or read 
below for more details:

    We are pleased to announce the 2017 NetFPGA Design Challenge!

    NetFPGA platforms are used by the networked systems community for close to 
    a decade. The platforms enable researchers and instructors to build 
    high-speed, hardware-accelerated networking systems. The platforms can be used 
    by researchers to prototype advanced services for next-generation networked 
    systems. By using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), NetFPGA enables new 
    types of packet routing circuits to be implemented and detailed measurements 
    of network traffic to be obtained.

    The NetFPGA 2017 contest is a design challenge. The design teams are to 
    produce a working implementation employing any HW and SW design methodology 
    and targeting the NetFPGA SUME platform. The deadline for submissions is April 
    13th, 2017. The winners will be announced at the NetFPGA Developers Summit 
    (Thursday 20th - Friday, 21st April, 2017 Cambridge, UK).

    Challenge: Lowest Latency Switch

    Low latency devices are being increasingly used across a large number of 
    applications. Low latency solutions are few, and are rarely open source. The 
    goal of this challenge is to provide a usable, high performance, open source 
    alternative to use by universities and organizations who need the flexibility 
    of open source.  The systems will be evaluated using OSNT, an Open Source 
    Network Tester. Test benches will be available online, for users to experiment 
    and independently evaluate their design. The competition is open to students 
    of all levels (undergraduate and postgraduate), as well as to non students. 
    There is no need to own a NetFPGA SUME platform to take part in the 
    competition although, clearly, development and testing will be made easier if 
    you have access to this platform.  

    Team Prizes:
    First place: £500
    Best students project: £500

    The winning projects and runner ups will be invited to present their work 
    at the NetFPGA Developers Summit 2017.  All challenge participants are keenly 
    encouraged to attend the NetFPGA Developers Summit and are entitled to a 
    reduced registration rate.

    The design challenge prizes are generously 
    supported by IMC http://www.imc.nl/
