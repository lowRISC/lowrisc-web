+++

The [lowRISC 0.6 milestone release]({{< ref "docs/refresh-v0.6/_index.md" >}})
is now available. This release includes an updated version of the Rocket 
RISC-V core, a higher core clock frequency, JTAG debugging support, Ethernet 
improvements, and more. See the [release notes]({{< ref 
"docs/refresh-v0.6/_index.md" >}}), for full details. We've also taken the 
opportunity to re-organise our [documentation]({{< ref "docs/_index.md" >}}), 
adding an easy to follow quick-start guide.

Our next development focus is to add support for dropping in the [Ariane 
RISC-V design](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane) (from ETH Zurich) as 
an alternative to Rocket.

Please report any issues [on our GitHub
repository](https://github.com/lowRISC/lowrisc-chip), or discuss on our
[mailing 
list](http://listmaster.pepperfish.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lowrisc-dev-lists.lowrisc.org). 
As always, thank you to everyone who has contributed in any way - whether it's 
advice and feedback, bug reports, code, or ideas. With special thanks to Jonathan 
Kimmitt who has been the driving force behind this release.
