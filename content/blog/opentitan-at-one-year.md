Last year, along with our [partners](https://opentitan.org/#partners), lowRISC announced [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/), the world’s first open source silicon root of trust. The project has progressed rapidly since then. A recent [Google Security Blog](https://security.googleblog.com/2020/12/opentitan-at-one-year-open-source.html) post detailed key milestones met, our growth in contributors, and revealed news of the first commercial OpenTitan tapeout.

OpenTitan’s success demonstrates the value of the lowRISC [collaborative engineering model](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/digital-technology-and-the-planet/digital-technology-and-the-planet-report.pdf#page=65), wherein our full-stack engineering team allows us to serve as an essential development hub. Our governance support, open source expertise, and engineering contributions, enable us to provide a healthy environment for the development of high quality silicon design and verification IP that solves real-world problems.

You can see this collaborative approach in practice with such blocks as the [AES](https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/tree/master/hw/ip/aes) accelerator, and the [Ibex processor core](https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex) at OpenTitan’s heart. These were developed in close collaboration with our partners using the same shared engineering methodology that all lowRISC projects follow to build high quality IP: structured [development stages and review processes](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/project/development_stages/), our [comportable IP](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/rm/comportability_specification/) framework and adherence to strict [coding and style guidelines](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/rm/).

We’re excited about OpenTitan's future. It lays the foundation for critical security infrastructure to be built upon an open, trustworthy technology, and provides a pathfinder model for successful open source silicon development to drive widespread adoption and use.
