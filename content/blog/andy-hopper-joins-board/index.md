Today, we are delighted to announce that [Professor Andy
Hopper](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ah12/), CBE FRS FIET FREng, has joined the
lowRISC Board of Directors as Independent Chair.

"I'm delighted to be joining lowRISC CIC," said Prof. Hopper, speaking today
from Cambridge UK, "As digital systems pervade every aspect of our lives trust
and transparency become crucial. An open source approach allows for public
inspection of the principles and implementations being used. I believe the
future of digital systems will be underpinned by not for profit organisations
that provide design transparency and enable real innovation. I am putting all
my weight behind lowRISC because it is an indispensable component of our
digital world."

Professor Hopper, Treasurer and Vice-President of the Royal Society and
Professor of Computer Technology at the University of Cambridge, is a pivotal
figure in the UK technology scene. He was the Research Director of Acorn
Computers from 1979-85, during which period the pioneering ARM1 RISC processor
was developed<sup>1</sup>, and headed up the world-renowned Cambridge
University Computer Lab between 2004 and 2018.

Cited as one of the [UK's leading practicing
scientists](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/cn/news/the-uks-100-leading-practising-scientists/2010580.article),
Professor Hopper also has deep connections within the business community,
having co-founded thirteen spin-outs and start-ups, three of which have
subsequently been taken public. In recent years, the companies he helped
create have
[received five Queen's Awards for Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Awards_for_Enterprise).

The lowRISC board looks forward to working with Professor Hopper to grow
lowRISC CIC's engineering and executive team, deepen our relationships with
new and existing partners like Google, and maximize the positive global impact
of open source silicon design in a variety of high value target applications.

<sup>1</sup> ARM itself was subsequently spun out in 1990.
