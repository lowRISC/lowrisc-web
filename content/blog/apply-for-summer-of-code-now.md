title = "Apply now to work with lowRISC in Google Summer of Code"

+++
We are very grateful to have been selected to take part as a mentoring 
organisation in the [Google Summer of 
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for the second year running. As 
with last year, we're working with a number of friends from across the wider 
open source hardware community to act as an umbrella for a range of 
hardware-related projects. If you are a student who would like to be paid to 
work on open source during the summer, then take a look at [the lowRISC ideas 
list]({{< ref "docs/gsoc-2016-ideas.md" >}}) and 
[apply](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6271463900315648/). 
As was pointed out on the Google Open Source Program's blog, there is a [good 
showing from hardware-related projects in GSoC this 
year](http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/something-different-code-up-hardware-in.html).
The deadline for applications is this coming Friday, 25th March at 7pm GMT.

We welcome ideas of your own creation, but the [ideas we've suggested this 
year]({{< ref "docs/gsoc-2016-ideas.md" >}}) include:

* A trace debug analysis tool (ideally using TypeScript and Electron)
* Improving device-tree support for the Linux RISC-V port
* Various ideas related to the [Yosys](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/) 
  open-source synthesis tool.
* Porting a teaching OS such as xv6 or XINU to the lowRISC platform
* Porting CMSIS-DSP to PULPino
* Doom on PULPino
* Porting the Arduino libraries to PULPino
* Integrating additional open-source IP for lowRISC on FPGA
* Implementing a Trusted Execution Environment
* Porting musl libc to RISC-V
* A Generic hardware/software interface for software-defined radio
* A SPIR-V frontend for Nyuzi
* Porting an OS kernel to Nyuzi
