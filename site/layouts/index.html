            <p>This effort sets a new bar for transparency in trusted silicon, and lowRISC is proud to serve as both steward and not-for-profit engineering contributor to OpenTitan, the worldâ€™s first open source silicon root of trust.</p>
            <p>Silicon root of trust chips increase trust in the integrity of the infrastructure on which software runs.
              <i>Open sourcing</i> the silicon design makes it more transparent, trustworthy, and ultimately, secure.</p>
