    The lowRISC community has always worked to be a welcoming and respectful community, and we want to ensure that doesn’t change as we grow and evolve. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to:
<ul><li>
   be friendly and patient,
</li><li>
     be welcoming,

  </li><li> be considerate,

  </li><li> be respectful,

</li><li> be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others, and

</li><li> when we disagree, try to understand why.</ul>
</p>
<p>
    This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to communicate and participate in the community.
