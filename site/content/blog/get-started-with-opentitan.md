Interested in trying out the recently announced OpenTitan? We've put together a
video that goes through an overview of how the OpenTitan prototype system is
put together and how to get up and running with our pre-built release
(providing simulator binaries and pre-built FPGA images for the Nexys Video
Artix-7 board). It follows the steps from the [OpenTitan Quickstart
Guide](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/ug/quickstart/).

You can find out more about OpenTitan from our [announcement blog]({{< ref
"blog/opentitan-announcement" >}}) and the [OpenTitan
website](https://www.opentitan.org).
