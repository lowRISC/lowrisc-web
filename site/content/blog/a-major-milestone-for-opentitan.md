We are excited to announce today that the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org) project has hit a major tapeout milestone: a feature freeze of its open-source RTL.

Together with our partners, we began the OpenTitan project in 2019 with the goal of producing the world’s first open-source silicon Root of Trust (RoT). With this new achievement we are a step closer to realising that goal.

Getting to this point has taken a lot of coordinated work, as we've had to navigate the many stumbling blocks that have traditionally made open-source silicon development a challenge. In a recent article for EETimes, where we first made this announcement, we discussed the seven "deadly sins" that have kept open-source silicon from reaching its full potential — and how OpenTitan has addressed these difficulties, starting with our Silicon Commons framework.

By following this framework — which mandates a scrupulously neutral and strictly enforced governance approach, a mature, shared continuous integration, verification and development infrastructure, and a rigorous collaborative development workflow —- we have flipped those seven sins into seven virtues.

As a result, we are well on our way to fulfilling our mission to make this fully verified, industrial strength open-source silicon design available to anyone who needs it.
