lowRISC is delighted that [Andy Hopper](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ah12/),
lowRISC's independent chair, has been [knighted for services to Computer
Technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-queens-birthday-honours-2021).

Andy said "As you might imagine I am delighted. What I have achieved is all a
result of teamwork. The University of Cambridge and the Cambridge Cluster have
provided a wonderfully collaborative and flexible environment within which I
have had the good fortune to work for over 40 years."

The culture he created, and his interest in and support for doing things in
non-standard ways, has helped to establish over 200 start-ups, including
lowRISC CIC.

Sir Andy Hopper, CBE, FIET, FREng, FRS, is Treasurer and Vice-President of the
Royal Society and Professor of Computer Technology in the Department of
Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge.
